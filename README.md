# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Slava -- a JavaScript Developer by day, and a .NET enthusiast by night. Sometimes I answer questions on StackOverflow.

# Today

I am a **Front-End Engineer II** at **Amazon Web Services**. On the side, I am currently working on a couple side-projects:

### Pixel-Perfect

Cloud-Native clone of Chromatic/Happo/Percy with some fresh ideas of my own. It is a large undertaking with an expected delivery of late 2023.

### ExtendedQuery

Configuration-as-code data fetcher with a builder pattern API as an alternative to [@TanStack/Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query). It is my highest priority side-project, as it has many immediate applications. See my [initial draft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10255546/207960718-b7462a7c-b946-4ad3-8880-835e3c45b7e9.png) for the implementation.

### TablePost

Pastebin but for dynamic tables. Exercise in working in AWS Lambda and DynamoDB inspired by [this tweet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10255546/208017069-42df8ad9-e52c-4c85-b584-67d189b05b95.png).

# Yesterday

Most notably<sup>1</sup>, I have previously been employed as a Senior React Consultant for **Airbnb** under **Capgemini Engineering**<sup>2</sup> working first under the taxes reporting org and later under the marketing org. Before that, I was a Developer for the **Public Health Agency of Canada** where I automated critical workflows and designed interactive data visualizations. 

<sup>1. I have held many other roles, [please see my resume for the rest](https://knyazev.io/resume/)</sup>

# Tomorrow

My goals for the next year are primarily focused on becoming an expert at All Things Kubernetes and taking the [CKAD certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad). My current role is an ideal fit for that goal, and as such, **I am currently not looking for any new roles**.

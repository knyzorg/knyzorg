# Today

I am a **Front-End Engineer II** at **Amazon Web Services**. On the side, I am currently working on a couple side-projects:

### Pixel-Perfect

Cloud-Native clone of Chromatic/Happo/Percy with some fresh ideas of my own.

### ExtendedQuery

Configuration-as-code data fetcher with a builder pattern API as an alternative to [@TanStack/Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query).

### TablePost

Pastebin but for dynamic tables. Exercise in working in AWS inspired by [this tweet](https://nitter.net/garybernhardt/status/1602825393194819584).

# Yesterday

Most notably<sup>1</sup>, I have previously been employed as a Senior React Consultant for **Airbnb** under **Capgemini Engineering**<sup>2</sup> working first under the taxes reporting org and later under the marketing org. Before that, I was a Developer for the **Public Health Agency of Canada** where I automated critical workflows and designed interactive data visualizations. 

<sup>1. I have held many other roles, [please see my resume for the rest](https://knyazev.io/resume/)</sup>

# Tomorrow

My goals for the next year are primarily focused on becoming an expert at All Things Kubernetes and taking the [CKAD certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad). My current role is an ideal fit for that goal, and as such, **I am currently not looking for any new roles**.
